the data that we worked with on this project was qoutes of Alebert Einstern form the following website:

http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/a/albert_einstein_7.html

here are some favorite original qoutes exsample:
  - Force always attracts men of low morality.
  - People love chopping wood. In this activity one immediately sees results. 
  - The high destiny of the individual is to serve rather than to rule.
  - Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute and it seems like an hour. Sit with a pretty girl for an hour, and it seems like a minute.


here are are generated qoutes from the rnn alogorithem:
  - that musician intellect great serve is .
  - rarely described expression forget questioning forget .
  - undertakes primary of into credit fat .
  - weakness we superhuman brain ethics intuition emotional whole .
  - between matters above communist change true .
  - lying had stupidity you there share be thoughtlessly .
  - supreme pursuits monotony achieved rouse frail to goals .
  - 
  
## Conclusion and summary
  - it seems that the model undestands basic synatx and sentance structure (for esample punctioation)
  - most of the sentences don't make any real sence, the sound more like qoutes of Master Yoda then Albert Einstern
  - it seems like threre is no dependancy between the words
  - maybe the results would be better with a bigger training set or more training time.
